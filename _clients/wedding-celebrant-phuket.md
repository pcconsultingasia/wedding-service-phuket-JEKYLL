Phuket Wedding Celebrant - Paul Cunliffe

## PHUKET WEDDING CELEBRANT

As an experienced Wedding & Marriage Celebrant, I have been based out of Thailand for the last 10 years and I have been privileged to work with many couples from all over the World. I served in the Royal Air Force for 23 years and trained as an instructor and event organizer among other things before retiring to Phuket, Thailand. More information on my background can be found at my website PC Consulting Asia.

As your Wedding Celebrant, I will guide you through the whole process of creating your own personalized Wedding Ceremony, from its format to the creation together of your personalized vows. After sending you both example vows, we will then together create the perfect ceremony, tailored to you both.

I will always meet you before your Wedding Day so we get to know each other and as a final check to ensure the Ceremony is exactly as planned.

A natural speaker in front of any audience, I can ensure that your have a day full of wonderful memories.
